https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand/,"As a 2-times $1M founder,These are the 5 Things I Wish I'd Known Sooner:🎯 Nobody Cares About Your Cool SolutionLet's be honest - I spent way too long being excited about features nobody asked for. People don't buy ""nice-to-haves"" - they buy ""need-to-haves"" that make their problems go away. How painful is the problem that you are solving?🔍 Get Picky About Who You ServeI wasted months marketing to the wrong audience and burned cash and time through the process before getting it right. Find your ICP and refine it relentlessly until it's laser-precise. Don't even think about running ads until you've nailed exactly who you're talking to and confirmed they actually want what you're selling.🌱 Fish Where The Fish Are BitingLook, some prospects are ready to buy now, and some will never be ready. I wasted so much time on the wrong people! Focus on high-intent channels where you can grab the low-hanging fruit. One good customer who's ready to buy beats ten who ""might be interested someday.""⏱️ Your Time Is Worth More Than You ThinkThis was a game-changer for me: before jumping into any task, I ask myself, ""Can I automate this? Can someone else do this?"" If you're doing $10/hour work when you could be doing $1,000/hour work, you're leaving money on the table.🤖 AI Won't Save You (But It Can Help)I got caught up in the AI hype too, buying tools I barely used, it’s not the answer to every question. Use AI to automate workflows and manual work to make more of your time. That's how I started buildingFuelgrowth- to strike that balance. We use AI to get deep insights impossible for us to derive and to make efficient workflows, but we know it's the human touch that really makes marketing work.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand/,"Over the past few weeks, the team atFuelgrowthhas been heads-down, laser-focused on execution, customer obsession, and building serious momentum.🌍 As a founder building in the generative AI space across Asia, I’ve had the opportunity to meet customers, partners, and investors across Singapore, Delhi NCR, and Bangalore. These conversations have provided valuable insights, and I wanted to share a few key patterns we’ve observed in the market:1. Early AI adopters are wary:Many early adopters have faced challenges in realizing the promised value of AI. This has created skepticism, as tools haven’t consistently outperformed human capabilities across job functions. 🚫2. Unrealistic expectations slow adoption:Buyers often expect AI to deliver end-to-end solutions, without requiring incremental user input. This mindset has delayed AI adoption, as stakeholders hesitate to engage with tools that still require human involvement. 🔄3. Enterprises are stuck in pilot mode:While internal mandates for AI-driven cost optimization and growth exist, internal champions lack conviction. Many enterprises remain in the pilot phase, waiting for proven use cases before fully committing. ⏳4. Midmarket and growth-oriented firms lead the way:There’s a silver lining: midmarket and fast-growing companies are actively experimenting with AI use cases. These early adopters are willing to be patient, collaborate, and become your initial champions. For founders like myself, these are the partnerships that fuel early-stage growth. 💡5. Offering “AI Outcomes as a Service” may be the answer:Another path is positioning yourself as an agency, offering “outcome as a service” by using your product to automate internal processes and building case studies that showcase profitable results. This can help reduce the risk/reward ratio for clients and accelerate market adoption. 📈The generative AI space is full of opportunity, but founders need to be strategic about how they approach the market. I’m eager to connect with fellow founders, investors, and enablers who are passionate about shaping the future of AI.Let’s build together! 🤝hashtag#AIhashtag#GenerativeAIhashtag#Entrepreneurshiphashtag#Techhashtag#Startuphashtag#AsiaTechhashtag#Innovationhashtag#Growth","['#AI', '#GenerativeAI', '#Entrepreneurship', '#Tech', '#Startup', '#AsiaTech', '#Innovation', '#Growth']",7mo •8 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn,44,4,0,18.0,Sunday,2248,8,0.9972176551818848,positive,False,4,"ai, team, us, startups, one",48

https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand/,"Static Ads Are Making a Comeback!Yes, you heard me right.Over the past three months, collaborating with various brands and agencies has revealed an intriguing insight that challenges the current market playbooks.Our data and performance analysis comparing UGC reels and static ads clearly show a winner.If you're a brand looking to leverage social media platforms to boost engagement across your funnel, static creatives must be part of your content strategy. Here are three compelling reasons why:Reel Fatigue: Attention spans are dwindling, and users are becoming more selective about the content they consume. Static ads offer a refreshing change.Cost and Authenticity Issues with UGC: User-generated content is becomingincreasingly expensive. Users are savvy and can spot a sales pitch a mile away. Brands need to push more authentic data through UGC to stand out.Message Clarity: Static ads allow brands to convey their message quickly and clearly as users scroll. Well-designed static ads, when intelligently positioned and targeted, drive better results.And the most crucial reason:Efficiency in Performance Marketing: Today's performance marketing thrives on rapid iterations and A/B testing. Static ads are cheaper and quicker to produce, allowing performance marketers to experiment more freely and optimize data-backed campaigns for better outcomes.If you're a marketer, brand owner, content/brand head, or P&L owner, and this resonates with you—or if you have contrarian views—I’d love to hear from you.hashtag#Contenthashtag#PerformanceMarketinghashtag#AIhashtag#DTChashtag#Growth","['#Content', '#PerformanceMarketing', '#AI', '#DTC', '#Growth']",10mo •11 months ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn,26,1,0,18.0,Sunday,1593,5,0.9641198515892029,positive,False,4,"ai, team, us, startups, one",27

https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarongolbin/,"Cold outreach to VCs and angel investors can be a strategic move for startups seeking investment. While it may seem daunting to reach out to potential investors without a prior connection, the benefits can outweigh the initial discomfort.Here are several advantages of cold emailing VCs and angel investors:Access to Capital: One of the most obvious benefits is access to capital. VCs and angel investors are always on the lookout for promising startups to invest in. By cold emailing them, you're putting your startup on their radar and opening up the possibility of securing funding that could be crucial for your company's growth.Expand Yourhashtag#Network: Even if the investor you email doesn't end up investing in your startup, they may still offer valuable feedback, introductions to otherhashtag#investors, or advice on how to improve your pitch. Building relationships with investors can also lead to future opportunities and partnerships.Efficiency: Cold outreach allows you to reach a large number of potential investors quickly and efficiently. While networking events and warm introductions can also be valuable, they often require more time and effort to organize. Cold emailing/messaging allows you to make your pitch to multiple investors simultaneously, increasing your chances of getting a positive response.LinkedInas a Tool:hashtag#LinkedIncan be an effective tool for researching potential investors and personalizing your cold emails. By studying anhashtag#investor's profile, you can learn about their investment interests, portfolio companies, and any shared connections you may have. This information can help you tailor your pitch to resonate with the investor and increase the likelihood of a positive response.Control over the Narrative: When cold emailing investors, you have control over the narrative of your pitch. You can carefully craft your message to highlight your startup's unique value proposition, market potential, and traction. This allows you to present your company in the best possible light and make a compelling case for why the investor should take a closer look.Practice Pitching: Cold emailing investors provides an opportunity to practice and refine your pitch. As you reach out to different investors and receive feedback, you'll learn what resonates with them and how to effectively communicate the value of yourhashtag#startup. This experience will serve you well not only in fundraising but also in other aspects of growing yourhashtag#business, such ashashtag#salesandhashtag#marketing.In summary, cold emailinghashtag#VCsandhashtag#angelinvestorscan be a valuable strategy for startups looking to secure investment.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarongolbin/,"🏈 The NFL's Touchdown in Venture Capital: A Winning Strategy 🏈👉 Introduction: TheNational Football League (NFL), long known for its on-field excellence, has also demonstrated a keen business acumen off the gridiron. One of the league's most intriguing off-field endeavors has been its foray into venture capital. This case study delves into the NFL's venture capital initiatives, exploring how the league has leveraged its brand, resources, and partnerships to score big in the world ofhashtag#startupsandhashtag#innovation.💼 Venture Capital Investments: The NFL, through its rather secretive venture arm 32 Equity, started making strategic investments in promising startups. These investments encompass various sectors within the sports and entertainment industry, from health and wellness tech to media and content delivery platforms. One notable investment is inFanatics, a leading sports merchandise retailer, which has become a unicorn. This investment allowed the NFL to tap into the rapidly growing e-commerce market while expanding its fan engagement capabilities.🤝 Strategic Partnerships: Beyond direct investments, the NFL fostered strategic partnerships with tech giants likehashtag#Microsoftandhashtag#Amazon. These partnerships not only enhanced the league's digital infrastructure but also helped develop cutting-edge solutions for in-game analytics, fan experiences, and content delivery. The NFL's partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) resulted in the Next Gen Stats platform, which revolutionized how football data is collected and analyzed, providing fans with a deeper understanding of the game.📺 Brand Synergy: The NFL leveraged its brand equity to attract startups seeking credibility and visibility. Entrepreneurs saw the NFL as a trusted partner that could help accelerate their growth by providing access to a vast and engaged fan base. This brand synergy created a win-win situation, as the NFL gained access to innovative technologies while startups received invaluable exposure and support.⛑ Impact: The NFL's venture capital efforts have yielded substantial benefits. It has not only stayed ahead of the curve in terms of technology adoption but has also diversified its revenue streams. Investments in startups have contributed to the league's growing digital presence and fan engagement, while partnerships with tech giants have enhanced the in-game experience for fans and players alike.Conclusion: The NFL'shashtag#VentureCapitaljourney exemplifies how a traditional sports league can successfully navigate the startup landscape. By making strategic investments, forming key partnerships, and capitalizing on its brand strength, thehashtag#NFLhas not only embraced innovation but has also paved the way for other sports organizations to follow suit.

They may make a largely misleading argument like “the risk of deepfakes that exist in many of these places will sway public opinion based on false information.” If that happens, people’s access to a largely accurate set of information from a variety of viewpoints and all sides of the aisle will be tremendously decreased or become non-existent.How do we stop these things from happening?We need to develop a public-private partnership that consists of strong regulations against deepfakes and similar emerging threats, as a result of largely good technology like AI and deep learning, and create measures to stop them from ever being posted.hashtag#technologyhashtag#aihashtag#deeplearninghashtag#deepfake","['#technology', '#ai', '#deeplearning', '#deepfake']",2yr • Edited •2 years ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn,14,4,0,,,1670,4,-0.9978358149528503,negative,False,4,"ai, team, us, startups, one",18

This is a big jump from $246 billion in 2024.Here are some key points:➡️ Massive Investments: Amazon plans to spend $100 billion, followed by Microsoft with $80 billion and Google with $75 billion. Most of this money is going into data centers to support AI growth.➡️ AI and Cloud: AI is driving cloud services forward. Microsoft Azure grew by 31% last year, and Google Cloud is focusing on security to win more business customers.➡️ Acquisitions Are Back: After a slowdown, big companies are buying again. Alphabet’s $33 billion deal for Wiz shows how important AI-focused acquisitions have become. Nvidia is also leading in funding AI startups.➡️ New Markets: Companies are exploring areas like humanoid robots and general-purpose AI agents that could change industries.AI is driving big tech's investments and hiring has ramped up again.Have we surpassed the AI trough of disillusionment?

Es geht darum, eine ganzheitliche Perspektive einzunehmen, die eine Balance aus technologischen Möglichkeiten und den weiteren Konsequenzen der Nutzung mit sich bringt. Ich kann aus den bisherigen Projekten folgende Learnings empfehlen:𝟏. 𝐌𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐦 𝐄𝐧𝐝𝐞 𝐢𝐦 𝐊𝐨𝐩𝐟 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐧:Organisationen müssen herausfinden, wie Mitarbeiter nach der Automatisierung routinemäßiger Aufgaben durch KI Mehrwert schaffen können. Man sollte sich frühzeitig überlegen, wie und womit Rollen neu angereichert werden, wenn KI voll autonom läuft.𝟐. 𝐀𝐮𝐟 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐭 𝐤𝐨𝐧𝐳𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧:Um die Produktivitätsvorteile mit KI zu maximieren, sollten Organisationen den Output statt den Input belohnen. Es geht nicht darum wer wie viel mit KI arbeitet, sondern wie gut der Output ist und ob sich dieser an der KI Governance orientiert. Dazu bedarf es einem Upskilling der (zukünftigen) KI-Nutzer.𝟑. 𝐌𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐜𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐚̈𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐤𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐧 𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐛𝐚𝐮𝐞𝐧:Die Zukunftssicherung der Belegschaft erfordert die Betonung von Fähigkeiten, die KI einfach nicht ersetzen kann, wie emotionale Intelligenz, Selbstreflexion aber auch Neugier. Es Mitarbeitern zu ermöglichen sich mehr auf den Ausbau der eigenen Fähigkeiten zu konzentrieren, macht die gesamte Organisation besser und die Menschen noch zufriedener.𝟒. 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞 𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐮̈𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐧:Eine Kultur des Experimentierens sollte gefördert werden, um schnell auf Veränderungen zu reagieren und kontinuierlich zu lernen. Dies ermöglicht es Organisationen, neue Ideen zu testen und anzupassen, um wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben.𝟓. 𝐄𝐢𝐧 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐟𝐮̈𝐫 𝐖𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐦 𝐰𝐞𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧:Um exponentielles Wachstum zu erreichen, ist es entscheidend, die Denkweise zu ändern und bereit zu sein, die Organisation neu zu erfinden.

𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐡 𝐮̈𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐢𝐞 𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐧 𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐳𝐞𝐧 𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐮𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐧:KI kann - je nach Art der Lösung - über die eigenen Grenzen hinaus genutzt werden.

𝐊𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧 𝐢𝐦 𝐁𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐧:Nur wenige Unternehmen haben sich bisher darüber Gedanken gemacht, was die intensive Nutzung von KI eines jeden Mitarbeiters für die Gesamtkosten bedeutet.

Parallel dazu wurde das Premium-Abonnement ChatGPT Pro für 200 US-Dollar pro Monat vorgestellt, das unbegrenzten Zugang zur Pro-Version des Modells o1 bietet. Dieses richtet sich vor allem an professionelle Anwender wie Forscher, Ingenieure und Entwickler.Das o1-Modell zeigt deutliche Fortschritte bei komplexen Aufgaben wie Mathematik, Programmierung und wissenschaftlichen Analysen. Die Halluzinationsrate wurde reduziert, während die Genauigkeit, durch “Chain-of-Thought”-Training, verbessert wurde.Zwei Dinge sind hier wichtig:1. OpenAI erwartet für dieses Jahr Verluste in Höhe von etwa fünf Milliarden US-Dollar, während die Einnahmen auf 3,7 Milliarden Dollar geschätzt werden, was mit den massiven Trainingskosten zusammen hängt.2. Allein der Betrieb von ChatGPT kostet OpenAI Berichten zufolge bis zu 700.000 US-Dollar pro Tag. Bei intensiver Nutzung eines LLMs, dass mit einem Prompt auf alle Unternehmensdaten zugreift und bei tiefer Analyse und Ausgabe der Daten durchaus 100.000 Tokens pro Prompt verbraucht, kann man sich vorstellen, dass 20 Dollar p.M. niemals ausreichen, um ein profitables Unternehmen zu werden.Was heißt das?

Natürlich sollen damit Befunde und Patientendaten analysiert und interpretiert werden.☝🏻Für einen erfolgreichen Einsatz von Med Gemini sind allerdings noch zusätzliche Anstrengungen erforderlich, wie die Anpassung an spezifische Use-Cases, die Gewährleistung der Datensicherheit und ethischer Standards sowie die Integration in bestehende Systeme und Prozesse.🤔 Also noch ein wenig Arbeit aber schon jetzt eine Gefahr für bestehende KI-Startups im Healthcare Bereich?Quelle: Forbes",[],11mo •1 year ago • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn,3,0,0,18.0,Sunday,1004,0,-0.9911633729934692,negative,False,3,"und, die, der, zu, mit",3

Und es gab keinen besseren Ort, um darüber zu diskutieren als das Alsterhaus, ein traditionsreiches Kaufhaus, das Geschichte und Innovation auf faszinierende Weise miteinander verbindet.Hier meine Top-3-Learnings des Abends👉 Customer-centricity: Egal ob Online oder Offline, Produkte und Services werden entlang von Kundennutzen und -feedback weiterentwickelt. Dabei sollen innovative Produktkonzepte, kundenindividuelle Angebote (wie Personal Fitting) und natürlich Premium-Qualität die Value-Proposition stärken.👉 Nachhaltigkeit im Fokus: Sowohl beim Betreiben eines Shops als auch in einer physischen Location. Dies erstreckt sich auch auf die Auswahl der Partner und Lieferanten. Gleichzeitig gibt es für alle Beteiligten, egal ob Lieferant, Anbieter oder auch Kunde, noch viel zu lernen und zu tun.👉 HR-Teams im Spannungsfeld: Ob neue Hirings oder die Erweiterung der Fähigkeiten der bestehenden Teams. Angesichts des Tempos und des Ausmaßes von Veränderung und Disruption, der sich die Einzelhandelsbranche gegenübersieht, müssen Unternehmen und ihre Mitarbeiter zunehmend agiler und proaktiver werden, um die für den Wettbewerb notwendigen Fähigkeiten zu erkennen und zu entwickeln.Ein besonderer Dank anAlisa Türck, die den Abend begleitet und das Panel auf unnachahmliche Weise moderiert hat.------------------P.S.

Geburtstag von Heidi, den dieSeven.One Entertainment Groupunglaublich gut inszenierthashtag#HappyBirthdayHeidi. Es ist Relegation und ich (natürlich) HSV-Fan. Sport bietet immer großartige Brücken in die Arbeitswelt. Als Stratege interessiere ich mich nicht nur für das Ergebnis auf dem Spielfeld, sondern auch für die Parallelen, die sich zwischen solchen spannenden sportlichen Situationen und der Arbeitswelt ziehen lassen. Und die sind einfach und klar zu finden.➡ Die Bedeutung des Teamgeistes:Egal ob auf dem Spielfeld oder im Büro, der Teamgeist spielt eine entscheidende Rolle für den Erfolg. Spieler müssen als Einheit agieren, sich aufeinander verlassen können und gemeinsame Ziele verfolgen. In der Arbeitswelt ist es ähnlich.hashtag#culture➡ Mentale Stärke und Resilienz:In einem Spiel wie der Relegation stehen die Spieler unter enormem Druck. Sie müssen mit Rückschlägen umgehen, Nerven bewahren und schnell auf unvorhergesehene Situationen reagieren. Diese Fähigkeiten sind auch in der Arbeitswelt von großer Bedeutung. Die Fähigkeit, resilient zu sein und sich von Rückschlägen nicht entmutigen zu lassen, ist der Schlüssel zum Erfolg.hashtag#balance➡ Zielsetzung und Fokus:Die Jungs haben klare Ziele vor Augen: den Sieg erringen und in einer höheren Liga spielen. Man könnte auch von persönlichem Purpose sprechen. Das erfordert eine klare Zielsetzung und einen starken Fokus auf das Erreichen dieser Ziele. In der Arbeitswelt sollten wir uns ebenfalls klare Ziele setzen und uns darauf fokussieren. Fokus hilft uns, unsere Energie und Ressourcen effektiv einzusetzen und uns nicht von unwichtigen Dingen ablenken zu lassen.hashtag#flow➡ Lernen aus Niederlagen:Nicht immer kann man als Sieger aus einem Spiel oder einer Situation hervorgehen. Niederlagen gehören zum Sport und zur Arbeitswelt gleichermaßen dazu. Es geht darum, aus Fehlern zu lernen, sich weiterzuentwickeln und gestärkt aus Rückschlägen hervorzugehen.hashtag#iterationFazit:Wir sind alle Corporate Athletes und können ganz einfach vom Sport lernen.Btw.: Live beiJoyn GmbHoder auf Sat.1 bei ranhashtag#Teamgeisthashtag#Resilienzhashtag#Fokushashtag#PeakPerformancehashtag#Motivation","['#HappyBirthdayHeidi', '#culture', '#balance', '#flow', '#iterationFazit', '#Teamgeist', '#Resilienz', '#Fokus', '#PeakPerformance', '#Motivation']",1yr • Edited •2 years ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn,5,7,0,,,2218,10,-0.9909289479255676,negative,False,3,"und, die, der, zu, mit",12

Wir können die Zukunft nur gemeinsam gestalten 🌱2015 wurde seitens derUnited Nationsder Aktionsplan „Transformation unserer Welt: die Agenda 2020 für nachhaltige Entwicklung“ ins Leben gerufen. Die 17 SDG habe ich als Grundlage genommen und die Strategie dahingehend entwickelt:📚hochwertige BildungDer PLC hat sich der Aus- und Weiterbildung von Mitarbeitern und Mitgliedern verschrieben. Laufende interne Fortbildungen haben einen ebenso hohen Stellenwert wie der ständige Wissenstransfer. Gelebt wird dieser bei unseren Veranstaltungen – durch den Austausch von Referenten/Experten mit Mitgliedern – sowie in der Premium Leaders University. Unter dem Motto „learn from the best“ haben die Mitglieder die Möglichkeit sich zu vielfältigen Themen fortzubilden🙍‍♀️🙎‍♂️GeschlechtergleichheitFür den PLC sind Vielfalt und Chancengleichheit zentrale Elemente der strategischen Ausrichtung. Jede Mitarbeiterin und jeder Mitarbeiter erhält eine faire Chance, sein/ihr Talent und Potenzial voll zu entfalten und so einen persönlichen Beitrag zum Unternehmenserfolg zu leisten. Als Mitglied der InitiativeUnited NationsWOMEN hat sich der PLC auch den sieben Prinzipien deshashtag#Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) verschrieben (https://lnkd.in/d-8M6xH2) wobei die Gründungspartner die UN Women und United Nations Global Compact sind.🙏 Menschenwürdige Arbeit & WirtschaftswachstumDer PLC legt größten Wert darauf, denhashtag#MitarbeiterInnenein attraktives Arbeitsumfeld und eine angemessene Vergütung zu bieten. Ziel des PLC ist es, der beste Arbeitgeber in der Branche zu sein und eine Vereinbarkeit von Beruf, Familie und Privatleben zu ermöglichen. Gemessen wird die Zufriedenheit durch regelmäßige Gespräche, um gemeinsam noch besser zu werden.🤝 Industrie, Innovation und InfrastrukturDer PLC trägt dafür Sorge, sein Geschäftsmodell langfristig und zukunftsfähig auszurichten. Mit allen Geschäftspartnern wird eine partnerschaftliche Kooperation angestrebt. Zuverlässig und wertschätzend miteinander zu arbeiten, gemeinsam zu wachsen und erfolgreich zu werden, ist für den PLC sehr wichtig. Damit wird ein Beitrag für die Gesellschaft geleistet.🌳Der PLC kompensiert das Co2 der Autos mit demClimatePartnerin Deutschland.

Dann können Händler:innen keine Live-Shopping-Events mehr auf Facebook veranstalten. Es wird jedoch weiterhin möglich sein, Veranstaltungen mit Facebook Live zu übertragen. Das Erstellen von Produkt-Playlists oder das Taggen von Produkten in Facebook Live-Videos wird jedoch nicht mehr möglich sein. Meta begründet diesen Schritt mit der Verlagerung des Schwerpunkts auf Reels.➡️https://lnkd.in/gitaEdnMZurück zum Alten – Algorithmus Änderungen beihashtag#InstagramIn den letzten Monaten hat Instagram erhebliche Änderungen an seiner Plattform vorgenommen. Dazu zählte die Algorithmus Änderung, um mehr Empfehlungen und weniger Inhalte von Urheber:innen anzuzeigen, denen die Nutzer:innen bereits folgen. Das führte zu wachsender Kritik in der Community. Instagram will nun die vorgeschlagenen Inhalte wieder herunterfahren, bis der Empfehlungsalgorithmus bessere Ergebnisse liefert.Diese Änderungen wirken sich zwar nicht direkt auf die Werbung aus, aber das Nutzererlebnis hat wiederum einen großen Einfluss auf die Anzeigenleistung.➡️https://lnkd.in/eJW2EjEGAmazons ""Freevee"" jetzt auch in Deutschland erhältlichNetflix, Prime Video und Disney+ haben in Deutschland einen Marktanteil von mehr als 80 % bei Video-on-Demand-Diensten.

Sein werbefinanzierter Video-on-Demand (AVOD)-Dienst ""Freevee"" ist nun auch in Deutschland verfügbar.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"We raised our $25M Series A just 6 months after our seed. Here are the four reasons why:1. The market is moving fast. A lot of new players are entering and we need to ship amazing products fast if we want to win2. We want to maintain our really strong momentum. A lot of startups lose their momentum and their velocity platesus if they sit in one funding stage for too long. Raising keeps the team excited, opens doors with bigger customers and builds brand awareness3.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,"As CEO at Artisan, I’m the only person who doesn’t have a college degree. Even though I didn’t go to college, you probably shouldWhen I was 18, I moved to London and started my first company instead of going to universityWhy?Originally, I had my sights set on studying PPE at Oxford and then founding a companyBut when I was 16, I realized that going to college was going to suck 4 years of my life from me - time that I could spend ACTUALLY building a company instead of preparing to build oneI dropped out of my maths class required to get into the Oxford PPE course and fully committed to spending the rest of my life building companiesI spent my last 2 years of high school doing the bare minimum in class. I was focused on building, including my first “real” company, Assist, an app for people to book home services servicesI got special permission to use my laptop in class due to my “slow handwriting” 😉 and would sit in the back of class working on my startupI even tried to drop out of high school but my parents were not on boardSo what ended up happening to my first company?It was a total flop. In hindsight, my idea had zero potential and was set up for failure. But it taught me a lot that has helped me build Artisan today – way more than a university degree could’ve. I learned:- How to fail fast, iterate, and learn- What ideas are good and bad- How to hire and fire people- How to manage a team- How running a company works-----------But ironically, I still think most people should go to universityThe job market is tough and it’s nearly impossible to stand outI’ve never had a real job before, and realistically I probably couldn’t have gotten oneAt Artisan, we get 1000s of job applications every day and one of the first things we do is filter by university/past company. It’s not ideal, but it’s the easiest way to filter through masses of candidatesGetting into any sought-after career path - apart from becoming a founder - is going to require a top college degree or a lot of grinding and luckGoing to a good university definitely isn’t the hallmark of an intelligent, capable person, but it’s a surefire way to identify people that are smart and hard-workingIf you’re 100% sure you want to be a founder, don’t go to university. If you want to go down a traditional career path, then doFor founders, the 4 years could be better spent learning how to build companiesFor traditional careers, the 4 years dedicated to getting a top degree will catalyze the rest of your working lifeAnd if you have an idea that you’re sitting on, there is no better time than NOW to start your companyP.S.

This is how I joined the founding team of a hyper-growth startup, without any relevant experience.I spent a year applying to tech startups without getting any interviews or responses. I knew AI was a field I wanted to go into, but had no idea where to start. I only had ~1 year of experience working in PR, which would hardly make me stand out in a sea of applicants.Here's what I did in that year, which finally landed me the CoS role at Artisan:1. Created a list of AI startups that were fast growth, recently raised funding. I checked their job listings religiously.2. Went to local networking events for founders and startups.3. Checked the YC job board daily.4. Used AI in every part of my life and read up on it constantly.5. Reached out to people I thought were interesting on LinkedIn for coffee chats & insights into the industry.6. Applied to every open listing that I was remotely interested in.In December 2023, I got an interview with ElevenLabs. It was the first sign since I started my job hunt that someone was interested. The interviews went well, but as a Series A company, they were looking for someone with way more experience. I was crushed.In January, I applied toArtisanvia their careers form (artisan.co/careers), not expecting to hear back. The next day,Jaspar Carmichael-Jackmessaged me to chat.Here's what I did during the interview process that landed me the job:1. Phrased my background to justify every step of my journey. I studied English at Oxford (talent for storytelling), went into PR (business operations interest), then moved from healthcare to tech (wanted to contribute to tech's global impact).2. Was extremely responsive & hard working. I left Saturday plans early for a follow-up interview, spent all of Sunday on my interview task, and worked trial evenings until 12am, after my usual 9 to 5.3. Excelled at a tough task. Because I lacked experience, I was given a mammoth task to create a website strategy for Artisan's next product launch. I had no idea where to start. GPT was my consultant through the whole process, helping me create a framework from which to work from.4. Showed confidence in the value I COULD bring, despite my non-traditional background.Experience shouldn't matter in hiring. Look for intelligence, resourcefulness, scrappiness - qualities for thriving in fast-paced environments. Artisan took a chance on me, which paid off through my rapid growth and dedication.Build these qualities:- Resourcefulness- An insane work ethic- Perseverance- Confidence in your valueand you'll catch someone's eye soon.I've created a full doc on how to land the job you want.
